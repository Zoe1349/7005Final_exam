The case study focused on analyzing customer churn using predictive modeling techniques with the aid of SAS Enterprise Miner, Talend Data Integration, and Talend Data Prep tools. The primary objective is to understand the key factors contributing to customer attrition and to identify patterns that could help in retaining customers.

SAS e-Miner played a pivotal role in building and refining predictive models, particularly decision trees, and ensemble methods such as gradient boosting and HP Forest. It provided an intuitive interface for feature selection, model building, and validation, enabling the identification of significant predictors of churn.

Talend Data Integration was used to consolidate and manage data from various sources, ensuring that the data fed into the predictive models was clean, complete, and formatted correctly. It streamlined the data handling process, reducing the time and effort required to prepare data for analysis.

Talend Data Prep allowed for further refinement and preparation of the dataset. It offered tools for exploring data, and transforming variables as needed before the modeling process. This tool was crucial for ensuring the quality and reliability of the input data, which directly influenced the accuracy of the predictive models.
